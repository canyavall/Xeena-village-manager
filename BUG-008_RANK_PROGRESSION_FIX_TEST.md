# BUG-008 Rank Progression Fix Verification Test

## Bug Description
**Fixed Issue**: After purchasing a rank, clicking next rank level tried to purchase the same rank again instead of the next rank.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the GUI refresh mechanism. While the rank progression logic was correct, the UI wasn't properly updating after rank purchases:

1. **Server-side**: Working correctly - rank purchases processed and synced properly
2. **Client-side**: Data was updated correctly in `ClientGuardDataCache`
3. **GUI Problem**: The `RankTab.refresh()` method only updated button states, but didn't recreate the upgrade button with the new next rank

## Fix Applied
**File**: `src/client/java/com/xeenaa/villagermanager/client/gui/RankTab.java`

```java
@Override
public void refresh() {
    // Called when underlying data changes (e.g., rank purchase complete)
    refreshData();

    // CRITICAL FIX: Recreate UI elements to show updated rank progression
    // This ensures buttons display the correct next rank after purchase
    updateLayout();
}
```

**What this fixes**:
- After a rank purchase, the `GuardRankSyncPacket` triggers `refreshActiveTab()`
- This calls `RankTab.refresh()` which now calls `updateLayout()`
- `updateLayout()` calls `createUIElements()` which recreates the upgrade button with the correct next rank

## Expected Test Results

### Rank Progression Flow (Melee Path):
1. **RECRUIT** ‚Üí Purchase **MAN_AT_ARMS_I** ‚Üí GUI should show **MAN_AT_ARMS_II** as next rank
2. **MAN_AT_ARMS_I** ‚Üí Purchase **MAN_AT_ARMS_II** ‚Üí GUI should show **MAN_AT_ARMS_III** as next rank
3. **MAN_AT_ARMS_II** ‚Üí Purchase **MAN_AT_ARMS_III** ‚Üí GUI should show **KNIGHT** as next rank
4. **MAN_AT_ARMS_III** ‚Üí Purchase **KNIGHT** ‚Üí GUI should show "Max Rank Achieved"

### Rank Progression Flow (Ranged Path):
1. **RECRUIT** ‚Üí Purchase **MARKSMAN_I** ‚Üí GUI should show **MARKSMAN_II** as next rank
2. **MARKSMAN_I** ‚Üí Purchase **MARKSMAN_II** ‚Üí GUI should show **MARKSMAN_III** as next rank
3. **MARKSMAN_II** ‚Üí Purchase **MARKSMAN_III** ‚Üí GUI should show **SHARPSHOOTER** as next rank
4. **MARKSMAN_III** ‚Üí Purchase **SHARPSHOOTER** ‚Üí GUI should show "Max Rank Achieved"

## Manual Test Steps

### Test Setup:
1. Start Minecraft with the mod
2. Give yourself emeralds: `/give @s emerald 300`
3. Spawn a villager and convert to guard profession
4. Right-click guard to open management GUI
5. Go to Rank tab

### Test Execution:

#### Test Case 1: Melee Path Progression
1. **Initial State**: Verify GUI shows "Choose Path" with Melee and Ranged buttons
2. **Purchase MAN_AT_ARMS_I**: Click "‚öî Melee Path" button
   - ‚úÖ **Expected**: Purchase succeeds, GUI immediately updates to show "Upgrade to Man-at-Arms II" button
   - ‚ùå **Bug Behavior**: GUI would still show "Upgrade to Man-at-Arms I" button
3. **Purchase MAN_AT_ARMS_II**: Click upgrade button
   - ‚úÖ **Expected**: Purchase succeeds, GUI immediately updates to show "Upgrade to Man-at-Arms III" button
4. **Continue progression**: Purchase MAN_AT_ARMS_III ‚Üí Should show "Upgrade to Knight"
5. **Final rank**: Purchase KNIGHT ‚Üí Should show "Max Rank Achieved"

#### Test Case 2: Ranged Path Progression
1. **Reset**: Use new guard villager
2. **Purchase MARKSMAN_I**: Click "üèπ Ranged Path" button
   - ‚úÖ **Expected**: Purchase succeeds, GUI immediately updates to show "Upgrade to Marksman II" button
3. **Continue progression through all ranged ranks**

#### Test Case 3: Tab Title Updates
1. Verify tab title changes from "Guard Ranking - Choose Path" to "Guard Ranking - [Current Rank]"
2. Verify tab title updates immediately after each rank purchase

#### Test Case 4: Cost and Affordability Display
1. Verify emerald costs are displayed correctly for each next rank
2. Verify affordability indicators (green/red) work correctly
3. Verify purchase button is disabled when insufficient emeralds

## Verification Criteria

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators:
- [ ] GUI updates immediately after rank purchase (no tab switching required)
- [ ] Upgrade button always shows the correct next rank name and cost
- [ ] Tab title reflects current rank name
- [ ] Progression works through all 4 tiers for both paths
- [ ] "Max Rank Achieved" displays correctly at tier 4
- [ ] No error messages about "Already have this rank"

### ‚ùå Failure Indicators:
- GUI shows same rank for purchase after successful purchase
- Need to switch tabs to see updated rank progression
- Error messages about purchasing existing rank
- Button shows wrong rank name or cost
- Tab title doesn't update

## Technical Validation

### Code Review Checklist:
- [x] `RankTab.refresh()` calls `updateLayout()` to recreate UI elements
- [x] `GuardRankSyncHandler.refreshManagementScreenIfOpen()` triggers tab refresh
- [x] `GuardRank.getNextRank()` logic is correct for all ranks
- [x] Server sends correct `targetRank` in `GuardRankSyncPacket`
- [x] Client updates `rankData.setCurrentRank()` with new rank

### Log Validation:
When testing, look for these log messages:
```
[INFO] Successfully purchased rank [RANK_NAME] for villager [UUID] (cost: X emeralds)
[INFO] Successfully processed rank sync packet for villager: [UUID] (rank: [RANK_NAME])
[DEBUG] Refreshed management screen for villager [UUID] after rank sync
```
