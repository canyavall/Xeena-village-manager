## Critical Bug Fix Documented

**Problem:** Special abilities were originally implemented in `GuardMeleeAttackGoal` and `GuardRangedAttackGoal`, but those goals never executed because `GuardDirectAttackGoal` (priority 0) monopolized all combat.

**Solution:** Moved all ability logic into `GuardDirectAttackGoal.performMeleeAttack()` and `GuardDirectAttackGoal.performRangedAttack()` where combat actually happens.

**Test Coverage:** 1 dedicated test validates this fix is maintained.

## Test Organization and Patterns

### File Structure
- **File:** `src/test/java/com/xeenaa/villagermanager/tests/GuardSpecialAbilitiesTest.java`
- **Lines:** 1,017 lines
- **Tests:** 93 individual test cases
- **Nested Classes:** 14 nested test classes for logical organization

### Test Patterns Used
1. **Value Validation:** Direct equality assertions for constants
2. **Tier Gating:** Loop-based tests across all tiers 0-4
3. **Probability Tests:** Boolean flag tests for random mechanics
4. **Calculation Tests:** Mathematical verification of formulas
5. **Filter Tests:** Boolean logic for entity filtering
6. **Boundary Tests:** Edge cases like no valid targets

### Test Naming Convention
All tests use descriptive `@DisplayName` annotations for clear test reports:
- Format: "Feature does X" or "Feature has Y value"
- Examples:
  - "Tier 4 knights apply 1.0 knockback strength"
  - "Secondary target must be visible to guard"
  - "Area damage is 30% of base damage"

## Key Test Insights

1. **Knockback Balance Change:** Test explicitly documents that knockback was reduced from 1.5 to 1.0 based on user testing feedback.

2. **Different Probability Mechanics:**
   - Knight Slowness: 30% chance
   - Sharpshooter Double Shot: 20% chance
   - Enhanced Knockback & Area Damage: 100% (no probability)

3. **Different Slowness Levels:**
   - Knight: Slowness II (amplifier 1) for 2 seconds
   - Sharpshooter: Slowness I (amplifier 0) for 3 seconds

4. **Critical Architecture Fix:** Tests validate that abilities are in the active combat goal (`GuardDirectAttackGoal`), not the unused goals.

5. **Comprehensive Secondary Target Logic:** 10 tests specifically validate the complex logic for finding valid secondary targets for Double Shot.

## Maintenance Notes

### When to Update Tests

1. **Balance Changes:** If any ability values change (probabilities, durations, damage percentages), update the corresponding test assertions.

2. **New Abilities:** When adding Tier 5+ abilities, create new nested test classes following the same pattern.

3. **Bug Fixes:** If abilities are moved or refactored, update the "Implementation Architecture" tests.

4. **Mechanics Changes:** If status effects or damage calculations change, update the relevant test categories.

### Test File Locations

- Tests: `src/test/java/com/xeenaa/villagermanager/tests/GuardSpecialAbilitiesTest.java`

## Conclusion

The Tier 4 special abilities test suite provides comprehensive coverage of:
- 3 Knight abilities (Enhanced Knockback, Area Damage, Slowness II)
- 1 Sharpshooter ability (Double Shot with Slowness I)
- All integration points, mechanics, and edge cases

All 93 tests are passing, ensuring long-term quality and preventing regressions of the user-validated abilities.
