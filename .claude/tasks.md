**Problem**: `GuardMeleeAttackGoal` and `GuardRangedAttackGoal` were never executing because `GuardDirectAttackGoal` (priority 0) handled all combat. Special abilities were defined but never triggered.

**Solution**: Consolidated all combat logic into `GuardDirectAttackGoal`:
- ✅ Moved Knight abilities into `performMeleeAttack()` method
- ✅ Moved Sharpshooter Double Shot into `performRangedAttack()` method
- ✅ Removed redundant `GuardMeleeAttackGoal` and `GuardRangedAttackGoal` from AI initialization
- ✅ Added comprehensive logging for all abilities (`[KNIGHT ABILITY]`, `[DOUBLE SHOT]`, `[MELEE ATTACK]`, `[RANGED ATTACK]`)

**✅ Validation Logs Confirmed**:
```
[MELEE ATTACK] Guard afa51dc6 (Rank: Knight, Tier: 4) attacking Zombie
[KNIGHT ABILITY] Guard afa51dc6 (Knight) applying enhanced knockback (1.0) to Zombie
[KNIGHT ABILITY] Guard afa51dc6 (Knight) area attack hit 1 additional enemies
[KNIGHT ABILITY] Guard afa51dc6 (Knight) applied Slowness II to Zombie

[RANGED ATTACK] Guard 7948ad6f (Rank: Sharpshooter, Tier: 4) shooting arrow at Zombie

**Priority**: Critical
**Assignee**: minecraft-developer
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours
**Created**: October 5, 2025
**Completed**: October 5, 2025
**Validated**: October 5, 2025

**Description**: Fix critical bugs in the guard configuration system preventing users from changing configuration values and validate that changes actually apply to guard behavior.

**Reported Issues**:
1. ✅ **Configuration values cannot be changed** - FIXED: Event forwarding was broken
2. ✅ **No validation that changes apply** - FIXED: Added comprehensive logging

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Event forwarding broken at three levels:
  1. ConfigTab methods not overriding Tab base class methods (wrong names)
  2. Tab base class missing `mouseDragged()` and `mouseReleased()` methods
  3. TabbedManagementScreen not forwarding drag/release events to tabs

**Fixes Implemented**:
- ✅ **Tab.java**: Added `mouseDragged()` and `mouseReleased()` method declarations
- ✅ **ConfigTab.java**: Renamed methods to properly override Tab base class (`mouseClicked`, `mouseDragged`, `mouseReleased`)
- ✅ **TabbedManagementScreen.java**: Added `mouseDragged()` and `mouseReleased()` overrides to forward events
- ✅ **ConfigTab.java**: Added comprehensive logging for all mouse events and widget interactions
- ✅ **GuardDirectAttackGoal.java**: Added logging when configuration updates are applied to AI

**Event Flow After Fix**:
```
User drags slider → TabbedManagementScreen.mouseDragged()
  → Tab.mouseDragged() → ConfigTab.mouseDragged()
  → Slider updates ✅
```

**Files Modified**:
1. `client/gui/Tab.java` - Added drag/release method declarations
2. `client/gui/ConfigTab.java` - Fixed method overrides + logging
3. `client/gui/TabbedManagementScreen.java` - Added event forwarding
4. `ai/GuardDirectAttackGoal.java` - Added config update logging

**Build Status**:
- ✅ All 331 tests passing
- ✅ Clean build with no errors

**User Validation Results** (October 5, 2025):
- ✅ Config tab sliders work correctly (detection range adjustable)
- ✅ Aggression/combat mode/patrol/rest buttons cycle properly
- ✅ "Unsaved changes" indicator displays correctly
- ✅ Save button applies configuration successfully
- ✅ Configuration changes apply to guard AI behavior in-game
- ✅ All mouse events and configuration updates logging correctly
