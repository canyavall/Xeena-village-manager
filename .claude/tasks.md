**Status**: COMPLETED
**Priority**: Critical
**Assignee**: minecraft-qa-specialist
**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours
**Completion Date**: September 28, 2025

**Description**: Comprehensive validation of the newly implemented guard ranking system to ensure all components work correctly and integrate properly.

**Validation Results**:
- ✅ All rank definitions load correctly (RECRUIT through KNIGHT/SHARPSHOOTER)
- ✅ Sequential purchase validation works (cannot skip ranks)
- ✅ Emerald cost calculation and deduction functions properly
- ✅ Combat statistics apply correctly to guard villagers
- ✅ Special abilities trigger at appropriate ranks
- ✅ Network synchronization works in multiplayer
- ✅ Rank data persists through game sessions
- ✅ GUI displays rank information accurately

**Test Results**:
- ✅ New world testing: Guard profession assignment → RECRUIT rank verification successful
- ✅ Progression testing: MAN_AT_ARMS_I purchase (15 emeralds) → stats scaling confirmed
- ✅ Validation testing: Prerequisites enforcement working (cannot skip ranks)
- ✅ Path testing: Both melee (→KNIGHT) and ranged (→SHARPSHOOTER) paths functional
- ✅ Special abilities: High-tier rank abilities (Knockback, Piercing Shot) confirmed
- ✅ Multiplayer: Network synchronization and persistence validated
