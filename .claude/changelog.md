## Bug Fixes Completed (September 28, 2025)

### BUG-010: Blurry Profession Change Alert Dialog
- **Issue**: GuardProfessionChangeScreen appeared blurry and hard to read
- **Root Cause**: Missing renderBackground() override allowed Minecraft's blur shader to be applied
- **Solution**:
  - Overrode renderBackground() method to bypass blur shader
  - Used simple semi-transparent overlay (0x66000000) instead of blur effect
  - Improved dialog background contrast (solid dark gray #2C2C2C with white border)
  - Added text shadows to all dialog text for better readability
- **Implementation**: Followed same pattern as TabbedManagementScreen blur fix
- **Result**: Dialog now renders crisp and clearly readable at all GUI scales

## Technical Debt
- **Texture Blending**: Requires mixin-based solution for complete texture override
- **Equipment Rendering**: Visual equipment display not yet implemented
- **Legacy Systems**: Potential conflicts between ranking and equipment systems
