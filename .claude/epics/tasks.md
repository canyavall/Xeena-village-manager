### Phase 3: Equipment System
**Priority**: üî¥ HIGH - Active development phase
**Status**: üîÑ REFOCUSED - Equipment storage completed, rendering broken into focused individual fixes

**Current Strategy**: Individual priority-based fixes instead of comprehensive rendering system
**Reason**: SimplifiedGuardRenderer approach successful for texture foundation but 3 core issues require focused solutions

#### Task 3.2: Equipment Rendering - PAUSED
**Status**: üü° PAUSED - Breaking down into focused individual fixes
**Note**: SimplifiedGuardRenderer implemented but 3 core issues remain. Breaking down into priority tasks.

**Previous Approach Issues**:
- [x] ‚úÖ Purple/violet texture fixed
- [x] ‚úÖ Equipment synchronization implemented
- [ ] ‚ùå Texture blending still occurring (guard texture mixing with base villager)
- [ ] ‚ùå Passive arm pose (arms crossed instead of active combat stance)
- [ ] ‚ùå Equipment invisibility (armor, weapons, shields not visually appearing)

**New Prioritized Task Breakdown** (replaces Task 3.2):

#### Task 3.2.1: Fix Texture Blending Issue üî¥ CRITICAL
**Priority**: üî¥ CRITICAL - Core visual correctness
**Status**: üìã TODO - Ready to start
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

**Problem**: Guard texture still mixing with base villager texture instead of replacing completely
**Root Cause**: SimplifiedGuardRenderer's `getTexture()` override may not be sufficient for complete texture replacement
**Impact**: Guards appear as hybrid villager-guard texture instead of clean guard appearance

**Specific Implementation Approach**:
1. **Investigate Current Texture System**:
   - Analyze how Minecraft 1.21.1 handles villager profession textures
   - Research if additional texture layers need to be overridden
   - Check if base villager texture rendering occurs in multiple places

2. **Enhanced Texture Override Strategy**:
   - Override additional texture-related methods beyond `getTexture()`
   - Investigate `getTexturePart()`, `getProfessionTexture()` methods
   - Consider overriding base texture provider methods

3. **Alternative Texture Approaches**:
   - Research custom EntityModelLayer for guard villagers
   - Investigate ResourcePack texture override capabilities
   - Consider model feature disabling for base villager elements

**Success Criteria**:
- Guard villagers display ONLY guard texture, no blending artifacts
- No purple/violet fallback appearance
- Texture loads consistently across game sessions
- Other villager types unaffected

**Testing Plan**:
- Test guard profession assignment in fresh world
- Verify texture persistence through save/reload
- Test with multiple guard villagers simultaneously
- Verify non-guard villagers still render correctly

#### Task 3.2.2: Fix Passive Arm Pose üü° HIGH
**Priority**: üü° HIGH - Visual behavior correctness
**Status**: üìã TODO - Dependent on 3.2.1
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours

**Problem**: Guard villagers maintain passive pose (arms crossed) instead of active combat stance
**Root Cause**: No pose override system implemented in SimplifiedGuardRenderer
**Impact**: Guards look passive and non-threatening despite being assigned guard role

**Specific Implementation Approach**:
1. **Pose System Analysis**:
   - Research Minecraft 1.21.1 villager pose/animation system
   - Identify pose methods in VillagerEntityRenderer and VillagerModel
   - Analyze how Iron Golems and other defensive entities handle combat poses

2. **Combat Pose Implementation**:
   - Override pose-related methods in SimplifiedGuardRenderer
   - Implement active stance: uncrossed arms, alert posture
   - Consider weapon-specific poses (sword vs bow vs shield)

3. **Dynamic Pose System**:
   - Integrate with GuardRole system (Patrol/Guard/Follow)
   - Different poses for different roles and states
   - Smooth pose transitions when changing roles

**Success Criteria**:
- Guard villagers display active combat stance (uncrossed arms)
- Pose reflects current guard role (Patrol/Guard/Follow)
- Pose persists through interactions and save/reload
- Smooth transitions between poses when role changes

**Testing Plan**:
- Test pose changes for each guard role
- Verify pose persistence through game sessions
- Test pose during combat scenarios
- Verify pose doesn't affect other villager types

**Dependencies**: Must complete Task 3.2.1 first to ensure stable rendering foundation

#### Task 3.2.3: Implement Equipment Visual Rendering üü¢ MEDIUM
**Priority**: üü¢ MEDIUM - Feature completeness
**Status**: üìã TODO - Dependent on 3.2.1 and 3.2.2
**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours

**Problem**: Equipment (armor, weapons, shields) assigned through GUI not visually appearing on villager models
**Root Cause**: No equipment rendering layer implemented in SimplifiedGuardRenderer
**Impact**: Equipment management appears non-functional from visual perspective

**Specific Implementation Approach**:
1. **Equipment Rendering Research**:
   - Study how PlayerEntityRenderer handles armor/weapon rendering
   - Research VillagerEntityRenderer's model layer system
   - Analyze how other mods (Guard Villagers mod) implement equipment rendering

2. **Armor Layer Implementation**:
   - Add armor rendering layers to SimplifiedGuardRenderer
   - Implement helmet, chestplate, leggings, boots rendering
   - Handle armor model transformations and positioning

3. **Weapon and Shield Rendering**:
