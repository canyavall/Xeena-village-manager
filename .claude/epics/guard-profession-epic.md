# Guard Profession Epic - PLANNED

## Epic Overview
**Feature**: Custom Guard Profession with Equipment and AI Behaviors
**Status**: ðŸ“‹ PLANNING
**Estimated Complexity**: High
**Dependencies**: Profession Management System (Epic 1) âœ…

## Feature Description
Introduce a custom "Guard" profession that transforms villagers into protective entities with customizable equipment and AI behaviors. Guards can be equipped with armor and weapons, assigned specific roles (Patrol, Guard, Follow), and provide village defense capabilities.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Custom Guard Profession
- New profession "xeenaa_villager_manager:guard"
- Custom workstation block (Guard Post/Barracks)
- Configurable in config file (can be disabled)
- Custom texture/model for guard villagers
- Integration with existing profession selection GUI

### 2. GUI Enhancement - Tab System
- Transform current single-screen GUI into tabbed interface
- **Tab 1**: Professions (existing functionality)
- **Tab 2**: Equipment (guard-specific, only shows for guards)
- Equipment slots: Helmet, Chestplate, Leggings, Boots, Main Hand, Off Hand
- Drag-and-drop or click-to-equip interface
- Visual equipment preview on villager model

### 3. Equipment Management
- Guards can equip any armor/weapons player provides
- Equipment stored in villager's persistent data
- Equipment renders on villager model
- Equipment affects guard's combat stats
- Profession lock: Cannot remove guard profession while equipped

### 4. Guard AI Behaviors
Three selectable modes via Equipment tab:
- **Patrol Mode**: Guard patrols village boundaries
- **Guard Mode**: Stationary position defense
- **Follow Mode**: Follows the player who assigned them

### 5. Combat System
- Guards attack hostile mobs within range
- Damage/defense calculated from equipment
- Guards can be healed with appropriate items
- Death handling (drop equipment, respawn mechanics)

## Proposed Improvements & Considerations

### Enhanced Features
1. **Guard Levels System**
   - Guards gain experience from combat
   - Higher levels = better combat effectiveness
   - Visual indicators (badges/ranks)

2. **Guard Schedule**
   - Day/Night shift system
   - Guards sleep in barracks at night (configurable)
   - Multiple guards can share patrol routes

3. **Alert System**
   - Guards emit alert signals when detecting threats
   - Other guards respond to alerts
   - Visual/audio feedback for players

4. **Equipment Durability**
   - Equipment degrades over time/combat
   - Repair station at Guard Post
   - Auto-repair with materials in nearby chests

5. **Command System**
   - Whistle item to summon guards
   - Rally point designation
   - Formation commands for multiple guards
