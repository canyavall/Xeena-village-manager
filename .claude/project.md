## Current System Status

### Guard Ranking System Details

**Specialization Paths:**
- **Melee Path (Man-at-Arms)**: Tank-focused progression with high health
- **Ranged Path (Marksman)**: Glass cannon with high ranged damage

**Rank Progression:**
1. **Recruit** (Starting rank) - 0 emeralds
2. **Tier 1** (Guard/Marksman) - 15 emeralds
3. **Tier 2** (Sergeant) - 20 emeralds
4. **Tier 3** (Lieutenant) - 45 emeralds
5. **Tier 4** (Captain/Master) - 75 emeralds

**Combat Statistics:**
- **Melee Path**: 20â†’40 HP progression, 2â†’10 damage
- **Ranged Path**: 20â†’26 HP progression, 3â†’9 ranged damage
- **Special Abilities**: High-tier ranks gain unique combat abilities

**Economy Integration:**
- Purchase-based progression using emeralds
- Sequential rank requirements (cannot skip ranks)
- Total investment: 155 emeralds for max rank

### Recent Implementation Status

Based on the latest commit "new rank system" (3b1b1f0), the following components have been implemented:

**âœ… Completed Features:**
- Complete rank data structures (GuardRank, GuardPath, GuardRankData)
- Networking packets for rank purchases (PurchaseRankPacket)
- Guard rank GUI (GuardRankScreen)
- Client-server synchronization for rank data
- Integration with existing guard system

**ðŸ”„ Current State:**
- Rank system code is implemented and integrated
- Equipment system appears to still exist alongside ranking system
- Some legacy equipment files may need cleanup
- Testing and refinement likely needed
